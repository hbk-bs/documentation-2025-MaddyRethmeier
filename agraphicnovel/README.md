We decided to use Midjourney to generate the pictures for our novel. For coding we used mainly Gemini with a hint of help from Chat GPT. 
Our Story depicts the Lion Statue on the "Burgplatz Braunschweig" coming to life and exploring the present Braunschweig while relating every new experience to his past. 
The story is written as a poem with 21 stanzas with 4 verses each. 
The overall tone and look of the pictures was inspired by Persian miniature painting and Japanese woodblock print.
The focus is on the golden ornaments that grow on the lion statue (in our depiction not on the real "Braunschweiger Löwe") and the blue overall tone borrowed from the 
Persian miniature painting which we referenced.

# A Generative Graphic Novel Briefing

Narratives in the Age of AI

## Objective

  

Create a digital graphic novel that combines storytelling, layout design, and AI-generated imagery. You'll work in small teams to produce a web-based, responsive narrative experience using tools like DALL·E 3, Stable Diffusion, or Midjourney.

The story, length, and style are up to you--but keep your characters and visual language consistent.

## Your Mission

  

### 1. Story and Style Development

- Brainstorm story ideas collaboratively
- Define the world, characters, and tone
- Create a consistent visual style with AI image tools
- Consider generating text with LLMs (e.g. GPT) for narrative content or dialogue
- Collect and document all used prompts and styles
- Develop systems and tools to generate matrices and overviews
- Create a visual map of your story flow

  

### 2. Technical Implementation

- Build a responsive webpage to present your graphic novel
- Use HTML, CSS (FlexBox or Grid), and JavaScript (vanilla or p5.js)
- Integrate and lay out images and texts in a way that supports the story flow
- Consider interaction, animation, or sound if it supports the narrative

  

### 3. Finalization

- Polish layout and design
- Test on various devices (**phone**, tablet, desktop)
- Make sure navigation is intuitive (scroll, swipe, click)
- Fix layout bugs and inconsistent styles

## Tips

- Use AI as a _creative partner_--not a vending machine
- Be mindful of bias, stereotypes, and ethical concerns in generative outputs
- Reuse characters and props to build coherence
- Try prompt iteration or inpainting to fine-tune visuals
- Save all your prompts and experiments for documentation



## Deliverables

- A **responsive** webpage with your graphic novel
- A README.md explaining your story, process, and tools
- A visual map or sketch of your narrative flow (can be a PDF or image)
- A LICENSE file for your project http://choosealicense.com/
