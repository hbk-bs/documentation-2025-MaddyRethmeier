        <h1>AGI-Debate Club Feedback</h1>
        <h2>Objective</h2>
        <p>As a member of the AGI Debate Club, my team had to build a strong argumentation against the development of Artificial General Intelligence. Our main goal was to show that the risks of AGI go way beyond just technology and pose serious threats to our society and our ethical principles.</p>
        <h2>Argumentation</h2>
        <p>Our argumentation was based on three key pillars. Firstly, the economic risk: AGI could make many human jobs obsolete, leading to widespread unemployment and an unstable economy. Secondly, the ethical risk: AGI does not have a moral compass. Its ability to make logical but completely amoral decisions could have devastating consequences for human well-being. Finally, the risk of misuse: AGI could be used by malicious people or be a danger through simple negligence. We also brought up the broader issue of AGI's rapid development and the huge amount of energy and resources it consumes.</p>
        <h2>Main Problem</h2>
        <p>We argued that a central problem is the "hubris" of pushing forward with AGI development while ignoring obvious red flags. It is dangerous to believe that all of AGI's risks can be managed. The reality is that we are already seeing these problems in today's Large Language Models (LLMs), from spreading misinformation to encouraging intellectual laziness. The biggest challenge, therefore, is that these early warnings are often ignored, which prevents us from taking action now.</p>
        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p>Our solution was a proactive, precautionary approach. We argued that it is much easier to prevent a disaster than to deal with the aftermath. Consequently, instead of waiting for AGI to become a critical threat, we should be creating strong ethical frameworks, regulations, and safety protocols right now. We believe we should learn from the problems we are already seeing with current AI and use that knowledge to guide AGI development, rather than assuming we can just fix everything later.</p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>In the end, the debate did not have a clear winner, which really proves how complex this topic is. The fact that there was not a definitive conclusion shows that the conversation about AGI's future is far from over. This project was an excellent exercise in critical thinking, showing that the arguments against AGI are not just about technology but also about deep ethical, social and existential concerns that need to be discussed openly and continuously.</p>
