Maddy's Portfolio Site
This portfolio site showcases the projects I completed during my second semester in a clear and organised manner. I designed it with a clean, consistent aesthetic, using a neutral, dark grey-blue colour scheme for the header and footer.
Project Panels
Each project is featured within its own dedicated panel. To give each a unique feel, the panels are designed to mimic the specific colour and font of the project they represent. Each panel, furthermore, includes the project's name, a brief description, and a screenshot of its main page.
On each project panel, there are two buttons:
•	The first links directly to the project's GitHub repository.
•	The second, by contrast, connects to a separate page with my personal reflections on the project.

Navigation
A key feature of this site presents its seamless navigation. For instance, from any project's detail page, users can easily navigate back to the main site. The return links are designed to be visually uniform and, crucially, connect users directly back to the project's specific panel, allowing them to continue exploring my work without endless scrolling.
